# ReverseWorldclockPython
i m trying to make a python file that can find which latitude/longitude (or region ) has the time that was entered.
i have two planned approaches for this project.
One way would be to look up in an api to find the location where this time was.
So looking for any world clock api.

another way would be to calculate longitude and latitude manually and look it up in google maps to find the region.
so looking for an algorithm to calculate latitude and longitude from time difference.


## After project completion.
I kinda forgot the latitude problem that i would face in such program.
although on that note, i could use a for loop to list every major timezone on that longitude by running latitude from 1 to 180 and printing every unique timezone.
